  <h1>Ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML:</h1>

  <h3>Add proper alt texts to images:</h3>
  <p>Use alt text to provide access to the content of images for individuals who cannot see them, including people using screen readers or Braille output devices. Alt text is supported by most document formats, including HTML, Microsoft Word, and Adobe PDF.</p>

  <h3>Use Headings properly:</h3>
  <p>Use headings and subheadings to form an outline of the page. Do not skip heading levels. They help non-visual users (including search engines) to understand how the page is organized, and make it easy for screen reader users to navigate.</p>

  <h3>Add labels to form fields:</h3>
  <p>Use the HTML label element so screen reader users will know which labels or prompts are associated with which form fields.</p>

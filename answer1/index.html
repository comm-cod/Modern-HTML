    <h1>Some Features of HTML5 are as follows :</h1>
    <h2>Semantic Elements</h2>
    <p>
      When constructing an HTML script, the term “semantic” refers to the
      meaning of the text. Semantics, to put it simply, is the use of HTML tags
      that accurately reflect the content they contain. For instance, using the
      < div> tag doesn't suggest the content it will carry, however using the <
      p> tag suggests it can be used to hold paragraph information
    </p>

    <h2>Audio and Video Support</h2>
    <p>
      One of the many HTML 5 features is the support for audio and video. It has
      reduced the hassle of relying upon third-party services such as Adobe
      Flash player. To embed Audio and Video into your HTML document, you may
      use the following two tags, < audio> and < video> tags.
    </p>

    <h2>Canvas Elements</h2>
    <p>
      Canvas Elements is a top-notch feature that has made the tedious task of
      handling graphics easier for developers. With the help of Canvas elements,
      you can easily draw graphics using JavaScript. It is optimum for creating
      simple animations and drawing photo compositions.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsive Images</h2>
    <p>
      Earlier to create responsive images on the web, you have to rely upon
      several lines of CSS and sometimes JavaScript, however, HTML 5 makes the
      process handy by including srcset attribute to specify multiple versions
      of an image at different screen resolutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>It is a modern feature of HTML and several browsers that typically store data in the user’s browsers and can access them with the help of JavaScript APIs. This feature is useful for creating offline applications where data is need to be stored locally. </p>

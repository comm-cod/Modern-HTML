  <h1>Accessibility:</h1>
  <p>Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.</p>

  <h2>Why Esssential?</h2>
  <p>It is crucial for websites to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities of all kinds.It allows them access to the same information and services that are available to everyone and includes things like news articles, online shopping, online banking, government services and more.</p>

  <h3>Benefits to different user groups:</h3>
  <p>It makes it easier for visitors to use devices like screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other similar assistive technologies to navigate your site. Intuitive navigation using wayfinding clues like breadcrumbs make an effective way to help them find what they are looking for or what you want them to see.</p>
